I'm a software developer using modern web
technologies (with experience with Ruby and Rails while 
enjoying Lua and Rust). I care about accessibility, good UX, and
responsive designs -- just generally humane technology.

I'm a generalist, musician, and a team player who enjoys
improvisation, learning, and uncovering hidden assumptions and
expectations so everyone can be on the same page.

Using my experience as a luthier and instrument designer I treat my
process of creating software as the building of an instrument: making
something that is both simple and easily discoverable yet rewards deeper
interaction and study. In my free time I enjoy coding musical controllers
and interfaces for both the browser and various hardware devices.

Currently working on synthesis / sound / instrument design, chess, skateboarding, 
electric guitar explorations, carving out space and energy to live and have a sustainable 
career as an agoraphobic, and balancing free improvisation with intentionality.
